GNU General Public License (GPL)
No other license meets the spirit of Free Software better than GPL, to say the least, and that includes committing the license to the rights of users in using it and to the long-term sustainability and availability of this work.

Main Reasons for Using GPL: It Promotes Freedom of Software because all users are free to use, study, modify, and distribute the software. That agrees with the ethos of open-source development: collaboration isn't hidden. We use GPL to ensure that the software will be free for all users and contributors.

Copyleft Protection: Probably the most important feature of the GPL is its copyleftâ€”a provision requiring that all derivative works or modifications of the software be distributed under the same GPL license. This protects the community's contribution, making improvements or changes by third parties share openly with the public under the same terms. It prevents the software from being sucked into proprietary systems without returning value to the community.

Encourages collaboration: The GPL fosters an ecosystem of collaboration. Again, this license would guarantee that if the project has modifications or improvements, these become, in turn, open-source. An open-source community pertains to providing the developers with a method to share and contribute with others freely, where they are able to build upon each other's work. This approach very much improves the development process where the software is continuously improved and evolved in the open.

Prevents Proprietary Forks: Unlike permissive licenses (such as MIT or Apache 2.0), which allow code to be used in proprietary software, the GPL ensures that all versions of the software remain opensource. It prevents commercial entities from taking the project, making modifications, and then selling it as closed-source software. GPL lets contributions to our project be equally useful for every user, including any developers who might wish to improve on the work.

User Rights and Transparency: The GPL is about user rights. It allows users to view the source code, modify it, customize it to their needs, and redistribute these changes at no cost. This transparency builds trust in that developers and users alike know there are no hidden components or restrictions imposed that may limit software use in unexpected ways.

How GPL Benefits the Project: Sustainability: By licensing the project under GPL, we ensure it stays open and accessible perpetually. Nobody can lock down the software or make it proprietary.

Community Growth: The GPL, by its requirement that modifications remain open, enables an energetic community of developers that is continuously contributing back to the project. This way, software can evolve much faster, since it is receiving input from a wide range of contributors.

Ethical Considerations: The GPL values openness of source, and therefore its values are in line with ours: Just and open, free access for all in each particular way.
