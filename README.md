# ADA: **A**nomaly **D**etection in **A**steroids

## Background
There are millions of asteroids in our solar system, and every so often, some of them start to display characteristics - such as a tail or comas, like comets do - that asteroids aren't supposed to get. The goal of ADA is to detect the anomalies in an individual asteroid's behaviour from data alone and then send notifications to the public regarding these detections. Currently, ADA runs on data from the Zwicky Transient Facility in Southern California, but we are currently in the process of gearing up to use data from the LSST at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which is expecting first light in January 2025. ADA is an anomaly detection program designed for the **S**olar System **N**otification **A**lert **P**rocessing **S**ystem (SNAPS), which is an Rubin-approved alert broker. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
