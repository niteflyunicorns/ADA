## Suggesting enhancements
We are open to suggestions. To propose a new feature:
1. Open a new issue.
2. Use a descriptive title.
3. Explain why the feature will be useful. Please give clear, descriptive information.

## Reporting Bugs
A well-crafted bug report ensures that others don't have to follow up for more details, so it is important to thoroughly investigate and provide clear, detailed information.
Please follow these steps before reporting a bug:
1. Ensure you are using the latest version of software.
2. Confirm that the issue is indeed a bug.
3. Check the bug tracker if the issue has already been reported or resolved by others.
4. Collect all the information relevant to reporting the bug.

### Submitting the Report
Security-related issues, vulnerabilities, etc, should never be reported via an online tracker or any public channel. Those issues must be reported to the owner of the project via email (it is provided in the ReadME section).

We use github issue-tracker to track all the issues. Please follow the steps:
1. Open a new issue.
2. Provide as much information you can provide about the bug.
3. Include the information you gathered in the previous section.

2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b your-branch-name.
3. Make the changes and commit them.
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request: git push origin your-branch-name

In your pull requests:
